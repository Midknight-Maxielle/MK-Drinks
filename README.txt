MKDrinks (Copyright Midknight.Maxielle 2021)

MKDrinks is my first mod, based around the miraculous powers of juice beverages and the bottles that contain them.
It is recommended to find recipes via JEI until a wiki is made.

It is licensed under GNU Public License 3.0, which, TLDR; it's free and open-source software, and your only obligation
is to provide the same free and open-source rights to any user of anything you make with it.

Special thanks to many open-source modders and tutorial-makers in making this, too many to count, but in particular:
    + Kaupenjoe
    + vectorwing
    + diesieben07
